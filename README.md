# euclid, V2
Quick implementation of (extended) Euclidean algorithm to compute GCD of two integers and coefficients in Bezout's identity. Written to accompany my abstract algebra courses; uploaded as an interview code sample.

Version history: 
V1: computed GCD of two integers 
V2: added support for Bezout's identity by retaining info on row operations and performing them on an identity matrix 

Future changes: 
- want to compute GCD of more than two numbers (perhaps inductively?) 
- want to compute GCD of polynomials, not integers (useful for current computational algebra course) -> implement polynomial operations, esp. long division
